# KeyTermsRevise
This is a python program mainly written by ChatGPT to help my GCSE revision before it starts after 5 days.

It takes a txt document as input with a strucutre of word : meaning , and a blank line between each definition of word. 
The textFiles have several lists of keywords taken from AQA GCSE text book definition.
