abundance: a measure of how common or rare a particular type of organism is in a given environment

Active site: the site on an enzyme where the reactants bind

Active transport: the movement of substances from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution against a concentration gradient, requiring energy from respiration

Adaptation: special features that make an organism particularly well suited to the environment where it lives

ADH: anti-diuretic hormone helps control the water balance of the body and effects the amount of urine produced by the kidney

Adrenaline: hormone that prepares the body for flight or flight

Adult stem cells: stem cells that are found in adults that can differentiate and form a limited number of cells

Aerobic respiration: an exothermic reaction in which glucose is broken down using oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water and release energy for cells

Agar gel: widely used solid (gel) culture medium used for growing microorganisms

Algae: simple aquatic organisms Protista that make their own food by photosynthesis

Alleles: different forms of the same one sometimes referred to as variants.

Alveoli: tiny air sacs in the lungs that increase the surface area for gaseous exchange

Amino acids: molecules made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen that are the building blocks of proteins

Amylase: enzyme that speeds up the digestion of starch into sugars

Anaerobic respiration: an exothermic reaction in which glucose is broken down in the absence of oxygen to produce lactic acid in animals and ethanol and carbon dioxide in plants and yeast.A small amount off energy is transferred for the cells

Aorta: the artery that leaves the heart from the left ventricle and carries oxygenated blood to the body

Aphids: insects that penetrate the plant phloem and feed on the dissolved food. They act as vectors that carry pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi into healthy plant tissue

Archaea: one of the three domains, containing primitive forms of bacteria that can live in many of the extreme environments of the world 

Arteries: blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. They usually carry oxygenated blood and have a pulse

Asexual reproduction: involves only one individual and the offspring is identical to the parent. There is no fusion of gametes or mixing of genetic information

Atria: the upper chambers of the heart

Auxin: a plant hormone that controls the responses of plants to light (phototropism) and gravity (gravitropism)

Bacteria: single-celled prokaryotic organisms

bases(DNA): nitrogenous compounds that make up part of the structure of DNA and RNA. They are represented by the letters A, T, C and G

Benign tumour: growth of abnormal cells that are contained in one area, usually within a membrane, and do not invade other tissues

Bile: neutralizes stomach acid to give a high pH for the enzymes from the pancreas and small intestine to work well. It is not an enzyme

Biodiversity: a measure of the variety of all the different species of organisms on earth

biomass: the amount of biological material in an organism

Cancer: the common name for a malignant tumor, formed as a result of changes in cells that lead to uncontrolled growth and division

capillaries: the smallest blood vessels. They run between individual cells and have a wall that only one cell thick

carbohydrates: molecules that contain only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They provide the energy for the metabolism and are found in foods such as rice, potatoes, and bread

Carbon cycle: the cycling of carbon through the living and non-living world

Carcinogens: agents that cause cancer or significantly increase the risk of developing cancer.

carriers: individuals who are heterozygous for a recessive allele linked to a genetic disorder. Carriers have only one healthy allele so they are not affected themselves but they can pass on the affected allele to their offspring 

Catalyst: a substance that speeds up the rate of another reaction but is not used up for change itself

Casual mechanism: something that explains how the factor influences another

Cell cycle: the three-stage process of cell division in a body that involves mitosis and results in the formation of two identical daughter cells

Cell membrane: the membrane around the contents of a cell that controls what moves in and out of the cell

Cell wall: the rigid structure around plant and algal cells. It is made of cellulose and strengthens the cell

Cellulose: the complex carbohydrate that makes up plant and algal cell walls and give them strength

Central nervous system: CNS, the part of the nervous system where information is processed. It is made up of the brain and spinal cord

Cerebral cortex: region of the brain associated with consciousness, memory, and language

Chlorophyll: the green pigment contained in the chloroplasts

Chloroplasts: the organelles in which photosynthesis takes place

chlorosis: the yellowing seen on the leaves of plants when they cannot make chlorophyll due to lack of magnesium ions

Ciliary muscles: muscles that contract and relax to change the shape of the lens of the eye

Clinical trails: test potential new drugs on healthy and patient volunteers

classification: the organization of living organisms into groups according to their similarities

Cloning: the production of identical offspring by asexual reproduction

Communicable disease: disease caused by pathogens that can be passed from one organism to another

Community: group of interdependent living organisms in an ecosystem

Competition: the process by which living organisms compete with each other for limited resources such as food, light or reproductive partners
