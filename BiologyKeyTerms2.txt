preventing the sperm and egg from meeting

Coordination centers: areas that receive and process information from receptors

Decomposers: microorganisms that break down waste products and dead bodies

Denatured: the breakdown of the molecular structure of a protein so it no longer functions

Dialysis: the process of cleaning the blood through a dialysis machine when the kidney fail

Differentiate: the process where cells become specialised for a particular function  

Diffusion: the spreading out of the particles of any substance in a solution, or particles in a gas, resulting in a net movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration down a concentration gradient  

Digestive system: organ system where food is digested and absorbed  

Distribution: where particular types of organisms are found within an environment 

Domain: the highest level of classification. There are three domains â€“ Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota  

Dominant allele: the phenotype will be apparent in the offspring even if only one of the alleles is inherited  

Double circulatory system: the circulation of blood from the heart to the lungs is separate from the circulation of blood from the heart to the rest of the body  

Effectors: areas (usually muscles or glands) that bring about responses in the body  

Embryonic stem cells: stem cells from an early embryo that can differentiate to form the specialised cells of the body  

Endocrine system: the glands that produce the hormones that control many aspects of the development and metabolism of the body, and the hormones they produce  

Endothermic reaction: a reaction that requires a transfer of energy from the environment 
 
Enzymes: biological catalysts, usually proteins  

Epidermal: the name given to cells that make up the epidermis or outer layer of an organism 
 
Eukaryotic cells: cells from eukaryotes that have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and genetic material enclosed in a nucleus  

Evolutionary trees: models used to explain the evolutionary links between groups of organisms 
 
Exothermic reaction: a reaction that transfers energy to the environment
  
Extinction: the permanent loss of all members of a species from an area or from the world 
 
Extremophile: an organism that can survive and reproduce in extreme conditions  

Fatty acids: part of the structure of a lipid molecule  

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH): causes the eggs to mature in the ovary  

Genetic engineering: the process by which scientists can manipulate and change the genotype of an organism  

Genotype: the genetic makeup of an individual for a particular characteristic, for example hair or eye colour  

Gibberellins: plant hormones that are important in initiating seed germination  

Glucagon: hormone involved in the control of blood sugar levels  

Glucose: a simple sugar  

Glycerol: part of the structure of a lipid molecule  

Glycogen: carbohydrate store in animals  

Gravitropism: the response of a plant to gravity  

Guard cells: surround the stomata in the leaves of plants and control their opening and closing  

Haemoglobin: the red pigment that carries oxygen around the body in the red blood cells  
Heterozygote: individual with different alleles for a characteristic  

Homeostasis: the regulation of the internal conditions of a cell or organism to maintain optimum conditions for function, in response to internal and external changes  

Homozygote: individual with two identical alleles for a characteristic  

Hormones: chemicals produced in one area of the body of an organism that have an effect on the functioning of another area of the body. In animals hormones are produced in glands  

Hybridomas: cells created during the production of monoclonal antibodies by the fusion of an antibody-specific lymphocyte and a tumour cell  

Hyperopia: long sightedness, where the rays of light from distant objects can be focused clearly on the retina but the rays of light from close objects are not focused and the objects appear blurred  

Hypertonic (osmosis): a solution that is more concentrated than the cell contents  

Hypotonic (osmosis): a solution that is less concentrated than the cell contents  

Incident energy: light from the Sun arriving at the surface of the Earth  

Inoculate: introducing microorganisms to a culture medium, or introducing modified microorganisms into an individual to protect them against disease  

Insulin: hormone involved in the control of blood sugar levels 
 
Interdependence: the network of relationships between different organisms within a community, for example each species depends on other species for food, shelter, pollination, seed dispersal, etc.  

Ionising radiation: has enough energy to cause ionisation in the materials it passes through, which in turn can make them biologically active and may result in mutation and cancer  

Isotonic (osmosis): a solution that is the same concentration as the cell contents  

Lactic acid: the end product of anaerobic respiration in animal cells  

Limiting factors: limit the rate of a reaction, for example photosynthesis 
 
Lipase: enzymes that speed up the breakdown of lipids into fatty acids and glycerol  

Lipids: include fats and oils and are found in foods such as butter, olive oil, and crisps. They are made of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen  

Malignant tumours: invade neighbouring tissues and spread to different parts of the body in the blood where they form secondary tumours. They are also known as cancers
